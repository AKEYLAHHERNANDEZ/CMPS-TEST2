Purpose: This project implements a simple hash table using the multiplication method for hashing and linear probing for collision resolution.

Run the program: ./output

It Displays:
Inserting keys
Searching for a key
Displaying the hash table
Displays meaningful output for collisions, insertions, and search results.
